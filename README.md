# ECSE 211 - Design Principle and Mechanisms (DPM)

DPM is a robotics design course at McGill University. This repository holds the source code for all the labs.

## Lab 1 - Wall Follower

The goal of this lab was to build a vehicle which can utilize sensors to follow a wall.

## Lab 2 - Odometer

This goal of this lab was to build an accurate odometer for the vehicle built in Lab 1. The odometer utilizes the rotation of the wheels to
calculate theoretical values while using color sensor for correction.

## Lab 3 - Translation

The goal of this lab was to build autonomous translation capabilities for the vehicle built so far, while avoid obstacles.

## Lab 4 - Localization

The goal of this lab was to add localization functionality to the vehicle built so far.

## Lab 5 - Ball Launcher

The goal of this lab was to add a lever to the vehicle and add software functionality for it to launch a ball.
